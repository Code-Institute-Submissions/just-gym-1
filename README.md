# JUST GYM

The project was to build a responsive site that acts the same on all devices.
The UI/UX needed to be easy to navigate while being informative about the company and how to contact and locate them.
 
## UI/UX
 
### User Stories

The project was started by looking at the needs and requirements, for the owners of the Business and its members.
Once this had been done the user stories were added to a project board.[user stories](https://github.com/matt-pearson29/just-gym/blob/master/documents/userstories.pdf)

### Wire Frame Mock ups

After the user stories had been completed, Wire frame mock ups were designed for the site and agreed with the owners, and a commitee of members.
