# JUST GYM

The project was to build a responsive site that acts the same on all devices.
The UI/UX needed to be easy to navigate while being informative about the company and how to contact and locate them.
 
## UI/UX
 
### User Stories

The project was started by looking at the needs and requirements, for the owners of the Business and its members.
Once this had been done the user stories were added to a project board.[user stories](https://github.com/matt-pearson29/just-gym/blob/master/documents/userstories.pdf)

### Wire Frame Mock ups

After the user stories had been completed, Wire frame mock ups were designed for the site and agreed with the owners, and a commitee of members.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

[HTML](http://html.com) <br>Used because all sites need to be built upon a base of HTML code.<br>
[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)<br> Used to style the pages of the site for good UI/UX.<br>
[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/)<br> Used for ease of actions and layout.

The code was written using the online IDE editor [GITPOD](https://www.gitpod.io/),and has been hosted with [GITHUB](https://github.com/matt-pearson29/just-gym)repository and [GITHUB
PAGES](https://matt-pearson29.github.io/just-gym/).

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
